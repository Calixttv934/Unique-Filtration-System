        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are the pioneers of the concept of water vending using custom built RO technology based water
            treatment and distribution systems. We started a unique Licensee concept to penetrate into the market on
            a nationwide basis. We set-up our DeltaPure Water Points at more than 80 locations in 35 cities of the
            country.<br>

            <br>We had introduced the idea of setting up water vending machines at high â€“ foot traffic areas such as
            railway & bus stations, cinema halls etc. For this purpose we have developed 7 different types and
            models of water purification cum vending systems.
            Each machine is suitable for a particulars mix of raw water quality and consumption pattern at the
            location where it is to be Our WVMs are available with hot & cold water dispensing options as well and
            have a range of 30 lph to 500 lph.<br>

            <br>The raw water quality can vary from 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm. Nowadays we set up such systems only for the
            in-house consumption of building societies, factories etc. On 1st January 2005 we took over the water
            vending business operations of M/s Vending Updates Pvt. Ltd. Thus now we have the complete designs
            manpower and team required for designing and assembling their models of water vending machines as well.
